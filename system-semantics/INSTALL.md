## Building

(1) Install the dependencies below.

(2) Call `dune build`. This does not extract any code yet, but merely checks that the proofs pass.

The `Makefile` just calls dune directly.

## Installing with opam

(1) Install the dependencies below.

(2) Call `opam pin .` This should make the library available as 4 top-level modules for any other 
projects or coq file (assuming you are using a Coq setup from opam):
 - SSCCommon (this project extra standard library, basically a stdpp extension)
 - ISASem (The ISA Model interface)
 - GenModels (Generic model definitions)
 - PromisingArm (The promising Arm models)


## Software Dependencies

### Opam and ocaml

All dependencies install instruction assume you can use `opam`. If needed,
instructions are available here: https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html.

You need to add the coq opam repository for some of the dependencies:
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
```


### Dune

This project uses the dune build system. It can be installed with:
```
opam install dune
```


### Coq

This project was tested with Coq 8.16. If you want exactly that version do:
```
opam pin coq 8.16.0
```
otherwise you can install it with `opam install coq`

Until recently it was working on 8.14, but no guarantees are made to keep
supporting it. 8.17 is not supported yet, due to some dependencies (`coq-bbv`)
not working on that version.


### Sail

This project temporarily doesn't use Sail for technical reason, as generated files
have been checked in, it will start using Sail again later. As reference the
previous text is here:

> This project uses the head version of Sail that hasn't been released yet. The
> simplest to get it to clone it somewhere
> ```
> git clone https://github.com/rems-project/sail
> ```
>
> Then, if you want the precise version of sail this project was tested
> against, do:
> ```
> git checkout f421b04d
> ```
>
> Then you can install sail with `opam pin .` in the `sail` directory.


### Coq libraries

For coq-hammer-tactics and coq-record-update below

#### Coq Sail

The Coq Sail library is now in its own repository, do:

```
git clone https://github.com/rems-project/coq-sail
```

Then (optionally), in that repository, if you want the version used for development, do:
```
git checkout aeca2c5
```

Then you can install `coq-sail` with `opam pin .` in the repository. It should
install its own dependencies such as `coq-bbv`.

#### stdpp

This development use the unstable version of `stdpp`, it can be installed by
checking out the repository:
```
git clone https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp
```

Then, if you want the precise version of stdpp this project was tested
against, do:
```
git checkout 283bda3
```

Then you can install stdpp with `opam pin .` in the `stdpp` directory. Opam will
also propose to install `coq-stdpp-unstable` which you should accept.

#### Coq Hammer

This repository uses the `sauto` family of tactics from the Coq Hammer project.
To install it, do:
```
opam install coq-hammer-tactics
```

#### Coq Record Update

This repository use the Coq record update library. To install it do:
```
opam install coq-record-update
```
